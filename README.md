## Explanation and examples

Note that use of the scripting console requires at least Kicad 5, as in previous versions the scripting console was broken.

ALSO note that upgrading to Kicad 5 will require compatibility changes to your previous projects, and they will not be backward compatible. I recommend making a sample project in 4, installing 5 on another system, and then loading it so you can get a taste of the conversion process before you potentially make your projects unusable and have to back out changes! Obviously back up all your projects before you do anything!
